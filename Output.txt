[Music]

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
tivo

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,920
this car now is worth about eight

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,159
million dollars you guys know frank the

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,360
deputy design director at bugatti he

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,400
told me that

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,759
the average owner of one of these devos

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,280
already owns a 40 special cars has 40

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,280
cars already in their garage

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,000
you've got to be a super super special

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,640
bugatti client to be able to buy one of

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,439
these

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,400
you cannot just call bugatti up and be

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,200
like

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,640
hey man i love the devo can i have one

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
no it doesn't work like that they're

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,040
going to ask you

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,560
do you already have a shiron and if you

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,720
haven't yet bought the three

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,840
million dollar shiron that's it they're

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,640
hanging up you've got to buy the shiron

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,720
before you're allowed to buy this car

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,600
now the original price of this car was

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,520
about six

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,600
million dollars so you already had to

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,399
have a three million dollar bugatti and

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,600
then you could

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,079
maybe buy this six million dollar

50
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,799
divo because there are only 40 of these

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,799
cars

52
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,719
being made and that's why the price has

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,080
now gone up from about six million

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,119
dollars when it was first launched to

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
about eight

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,120
million dollars right let's have a look

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,040
around it as you can see straight away

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,239
there are lots of design changes

59
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,319
from the chiron to the devo

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,200
look at this the daytime running lights

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,360
are in this boomerang shape

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,000
and what they've done is they've pushed

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,000
them all the way to the edge of the car

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
just so that the car looks wider and

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,360
more aggressive

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,959
and if you look at the headlights itself

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,879
they're tiny aren't they

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,239
these are the actual headlights very

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,840
different from the chiron which has

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,319
those diamond shapes

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,480
in the headlights this is just very um

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,800
kind of i use the word squished

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,560
it's probably not the designer's

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
favorite word sorry about that frank

75
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,760
but they are a little bit more squished

76
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,720
which makes it a little bit more

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,160
aggressive

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,480
so there you go that's the headlights

79
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,200
for you around the side here guys

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,159
what's quite interesting is they have

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,200
split the car

82
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,920
in two so you've got this

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,480
blue segment here and this white segment

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,640
here

85
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,800
everything you see in blue is for

86
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,080
function so aerodynamics

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,360
the white is for design purposes

88
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,120
i think that's really interesting that

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,680
they've done that also the split

90
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,560
this split between colors is meant to

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,640
make the car

92
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,080
look closer to the road so it actually

93
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,840
looks lower

94
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,680
than the chiron but it's not this is

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,319
basically the sporty

96
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,720
lightweight version of the chiron this

97
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,560
is 35 kilos lighter

98
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,640
than the chiron is let's look at its

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,959
extra panels the louvers

100
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,120
air intakes out tanks etc here's some

101
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,720
nice little louvres for you

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,799
and that's actually just going to expel

103
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,440
some air from this area here around the

104
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,640
wheel

105
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:54,000
air intake here and around the back

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,599
this is super cool guys this is a major

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,720
design change from the shear on you've

108
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,879
got this fin

109
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,239
running down the back here now the

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,840
purpose behind

111
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,280
this is you've got the air

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,560
flowing through here down over the

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,560
engine bay

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,720
but in order to stop the air from kind

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,959
of circulating around here

116
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,000
this fin just breaks it up and throws it

117
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,079
out the back so

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,919
that fin is therefore again function

119
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,600
it's in blue guys it all makes sense

120
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,400
you've got four exhaust pipes here at

121
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,040
the back that are

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,960
visible and then you've got another

123
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,199
exhaust pipe here on the right

124
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,000
and another exhaust pipe here on the

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,160
left

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,320
so in all you've got six exhaust pipes

127
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,600
now you might think well hang on a note

128
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,800
why have you kind of hidden

129
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,560
two on either side of these visible ones

130
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,440
now that's for a very good reason

131
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,160
actually three

132
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,440
reasons the first reason is this it's

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,280
actually going to be too noisy if you

134
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,840
have all six exhaust pipes

135
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,440
facing directly back at you right so

136
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,199
they've got two facing down

137
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,199
the second reason they've done this is

138
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,080
to actually increase the downforce which

139
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,120
is quite interesting

140
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,440
the third reason is because if you have

141
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,479
all

142
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,280
six exhaust pipes right here

143
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,560
it actually gets so hot that these

144
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,320
little lights

145
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,759
to light up your rear number plate

146
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,320
can actually melt from the heat

147
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,320
coming out of the exhaust pipe so isn't

148
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,039
that crazy now the other cool thing to

149
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,639
show you guys

150
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,280
is this i love these rear taillights i

151
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,840
mean

152
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,560
how freaking cool is this it's not

153
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,919
hidden behind like a panel of glass

154
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,440
all of this is a 3d mesh

155
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,080
and you can kind of run your fingers

156
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,320
through it this is so freaking cool

157
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,160
these white panels here are the ones

158
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,000
where the light comes through

159
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
now in order to have the light come

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,680
through they had to

161
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,479
square off these edges if they just left

162
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,000
only these panels this would not pass

163
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,039
road homologation

164
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,440
because it would be too dangerous to

165
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,520
have

166
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,080
squared off edges so what they've had to

167
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,199
do is place in these black panels as

168
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,160
well

169
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,199
with rounded off edges and they're

170
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,360
thicker

171
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,039
just so that you can pass the road

172
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,759
homologation laws

173
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,919
engine you guys this is what is so

174
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,440
freaking impressive i just recently

175
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,600
drove the shiron

176
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,280
pure sport if you haven't yet seen that

177
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
v the link is in the description right

178
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,400
here

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,880
right here just go check it out that was

180
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
epic i got to floor a chevron pure sport

181
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,800
right

182
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:33,440
this is a w16 engine with

183
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,560
1500 horsepower it's actually an 8 liter

184
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,600
w16

185
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,360
and it has four turbo chargers

186
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,039
you can't even imagine what this thing

187
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,319
feels like to drive it is

188
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,120
so smooth it is so smooth and there's so

189
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,680
much power

190
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,199
i just can't even like ah i can't even

191
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,520
explain it to you let's get in

192
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,919
now what is just so gorgeous is this

193
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,759
interior you guys

194
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,160
look at this stitching here like little

195
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,639
birds taking off in flight

196
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,319
love that you've got full exposed carbon

197
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,000
fiber door

198
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,680
so you're going to notice a lot more

199
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,560
carbon fiber

200
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,080
in this car than in the chiron that's

201
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,560
because they're trying to save as much

202
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,000
weight as possible so you've got carbon

203
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,240
fiber here everywhere

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,240
you've also got carbon fiber here in the

205
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,319
middle look at all of this

206
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,520
it just gives you so much more of a like

207
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,599
a sporty feel

208
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,720
again you've got this beautiful sea

209
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,880
curve here

210
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,759
in the middle and this actually lights

211
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,400
up

212
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,400
in between you and the passenger and i

213
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,319
think it's just time to turn it on

214
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,599
what do you think i got the key i got

215
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,120
the key

216
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,160
i better give this back and not forget

217
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,160
about it here we go

218
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,840
bugatti divo key eight million dollars

219
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,879
sometimes i get a little bit like giddy

220
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,639
about it i just can't believe this okay

221
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,319
are you ready

222
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,120
oh some fancy shoes i had to wear my

223
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,879
fancy shoes i'm in a devo

224
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,000
there's a nice little slot for the key

225
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,240
which is awesome i love that

226
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,680
bulk and it sits there so it's not

227
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,599
sliding around everywhere

228
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:15,759
and then engine start

229
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:27,840
time to look at the lights actually lit

230
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:27,840
up head around the front first

231
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
so

232
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,279
foreign

233
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,480
it's just so deep and aggressive you

234
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,320
know you don't have the

235
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,240
like the high pitched or the screaming

236
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,080
or the gurgling but you have this deep

237
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,519
aggressive growl

238
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,000
and this interior i absolutely love

239
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,640
i'm in love with it it's just so

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,440
simplified and stripped down

241
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,040
you have only a few dials here in the

242
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,320
middle

243
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,080
your gear lever all right a button for

244
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,360
the radio

245
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,839
hazard and here if you look

246
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,880
at what i can see straight into the

247
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,720
engine

248
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,120
i love that view now what is super cool

249
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,760
here

250
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,320
is lock on your speedometer it goes all

251
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,240
the way

252
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:46,080
up to 500 kilometers an hour

253
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,080
on what car do you get to see that

254
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,000
that is so freaking epic so the top

255
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,519
speed is actually limited to 380

256
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,240
kilometers an hour

257
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,800
uh but you know it has the potential to

258
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:05,839
actually do that 500 kilometer an hour

259
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,839
okay this is the moment

260
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,440
now i've had a drive of a few different

261
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,480
chirons

262
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,959
and when i first drove a chiron i was

263
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,959
like

264
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,720
not sure about this experience it feels

265
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,480
a little bit passive to me you know it's

266
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,399
so easy to drive

267
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,760
i was just kind of driving in around in

268
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,320
back streets right

269
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,240
but recently i got to actually floor a

270
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,760
chiron and that was the moment that i

271
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,839
fell in love

272
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,720
with the shiron because when you have a

273
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,760
shiron you have 1500 horsepower to play

274
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,000
around with

275
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,040
that is the kind of thing you want to do

276
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,160
with these cars is

277
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,800
actually go and test what that feels

278
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,880
like

279
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,279
guys i cannot even explain to you how

280
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,519
incredible

281
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:54,640
1500 horsepower feels

282
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,600
zero to 100 in 2.4

283
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,640
seconds now when you're thinking of the

284
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,000
capabilities

285
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,839
or how quick all electric cars are

286
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,680
they're not even there yet this doesn't

287
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,040
have any power from any batteries

288
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:14,000
it's all from the w16 and it is super

289
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,880
super quick

290
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,440
ah it's music you know what i think it

291
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,240
every time i hear it's like

292
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,600
a big breath out it's like so relaxing

293
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,000
here we go

294
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:31,200
here we go and

295
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,320
i'm a divo owner okay

296
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,120
